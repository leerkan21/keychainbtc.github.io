    <h1>What is Bitcoin, really? A Friendly Guide</h1>
    <p>Bitcoin is a digital currency, or cryptocurrency, that was invented in 2009 by a person (or group) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It was designed to let people send money directly to each other over the internet — no bank needed.</p>
    <p>Unlike traditional money, Bitcoin isn't printed. It's "mined" by computers solving math problems and added to a public list of transactions called the blockchain. That public list keeps track of every Bitcoin movement in the world.</p>
    <p>Only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist, which means it's limited — kind of like digital gold. This scarcity is one reason people see Bitcoin as valuable.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin is also decentralized. No single company, bank, or government controls it. That means no one can change the rules by themselves or freeze your account.</p>
    <p>To store your Bitcoin, you use a digital wallet. And just like with an email address, you can receive Bitcoin using a public address — but only you can send it using your private key (your digital password).</p>
    <p>Bitcoin can feel overwhelming at first, but at its core, it's just a way to send value — from one neighbor to another — safely and securely.</p>
