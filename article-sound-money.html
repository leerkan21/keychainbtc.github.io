    <h1>What Makes Bitcoin Sound Money</h1>
    <p>Throughout history, money evolved from barter systems to physical commodities like gold. Gold held its value because it was durable, scarce, and universally accepted. These qualities define what we now refer to as "sound money."</p>
    <p>In the 20th century, many countries abandoned the gold standard, replacing it with fiat currencies — money issued by governments without intrinsic value. This allowed for greater control of the economy but also introduced risks like inflation and loss of purchasing power.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold. It’s not controlled by any government, and its total supply is capped at 21 million coins. This scarcity is built into its code and is enforced by a decentralized network of computers around the world.</p>
    <p>Bitcoin is also easily divisible, portable, and resistant to censorship. Unlike gold, it can be sent across the world in minutes. Unlike fiat, it cannot be inflated at will by central banks.</p>
    <p>According to economist Saifedean Ammous in his book <em>The Bitcoin Standard</em>, sound money encourages saving, long-term thinking, and responsible investment. Bitcoin’s structure aligns closely with these values, making it a strong candidate for a new form of sound money in the digital age.</p>
    <p>If you’re interested in exploring these ideas in more depth, consider reading the full book: <a href="https://saifedean.com/the-bitcoin-standard/" target="_blank">The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous</a>.</p>
