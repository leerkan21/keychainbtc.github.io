    <h1>What is the Blockchain and How Do Keys Work?</h1>
    <p>The blockchain is like a giant notebook that's shared with the world. Every time someone sends or receives Bitcoin, a new line is written into that notebook — recording what happened. But instead of a single notebook stored in one place, this version lives on thousands of computers all around the globe.</p>
    <p>This decentralized setup makes it very hard to cheat or tamper with transactions. Everyone has a copy, so everyone keeps each other honest. That’s one of the most important parts of how Bitcoin stays secure.</p>
    <p>Now, how do we make sure only the right people can write their lines in the notebook? That’s where keys come in.</p>
    <p>You have a <strong>public key</strong>, which is kind of like your Bitcoin address. It's safe to share, and anyone can use it to send you Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>But to spend or move your Bitcoin, you need your <strong>private key</strong>. This is like a special password — known only to you — that proves you’re the real owner.</p>
    <p>Think of it like a mailbox: your public key is the address where anyone can drop letters (or coins), but only you have the key to unlock the box and take things out.</p>
    <p>Using these digital keys, Bitcoin lets us send and receive money securely — without needing permission from a bank. And the blockchain keeps the whole system honest, permanent, and transparent.</p>
